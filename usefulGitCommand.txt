Copy that URL from the browser, go into the local planets repository, and run this command:

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
Make sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Vladâ€™s: the only difference should be your username instead of vlad.

We can check that the command has worked by running git remote -v:

$ git remote -v
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (fetch)
The name origin is a local nickname for your remote repository. We could use something else if we wanted to, but origin is by far the most common choice.

Once the nickname origin is set up, this command will push the changes from our local repository to the repository on GitHub:

$ git push origin master

We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

$ git pull origin master
